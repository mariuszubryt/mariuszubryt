Frontend-oriented product engineer dedicated to help people deliver quality solutions. I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet - things that look good but are also built well under the hood.

I currently work as a Lead Engineer at [Certifier](https://certifier.io), a digital credentials infrastructure. I’m actively contributing to product growth and maintaining a joyful developer experience. Over the years, I have been part of many projects and partnered with various brands.
